# QAMP Spring 2022 Transpiler Hackathon

Our Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Project for Spring, 2022 is a [Transpiler Hackathon](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-spring-22/issues/1).

Our Github organization is [here](https://github.com/QAMP-Spring-2022-Transpiler-Hackathon).

A web journal of our effort will be posted [here](https://QAMP-Spring-2022-Transpiler-Hackathon.github.io).

## 2022-03-04:

Our team of Harshit Gupta, Vishnu Ajith, Oskar SÅ‚owik, and Jack Woehr met today via Zoom.
We discussed the following points

* The 3 aspects of the Qiskit Transpiler
  * Coupling map
  * Basis gates
  * Optimization

### A blue-sky thought about Optimization

- Circuit optimization may be a paradigmatic example of quantum computation

- Current devices at our disposal are probably not powerful enough to achieve much in this respect. But see [this discussion about performing certain transpiler passes on the quantum device itself](https://github.com/qiskit-community/feedback/discussions/3#discussioncomment-1485832).

### Project plan

- Tackle [Qiskit Terra transpiler issues](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+transpiler) as recommended by the IBM Qiskit Team, particularly
  
  - Matthew Treinish
  
  - Kevin Krsulich

- We have no specific goal other than to be useful to Qiskit Transpiler development. We may find ourselves performing any mixture of the following:
  
  - PR many small issues
  
  - Work as a team on one or more major issues
  
  - Invent a new feature ourselves

- We will meet weekly starting 2022-03-14

#### First step

Matthew Treinish requests that the team help out with [#7113 Add support for BackendV2 and Target to transpiler](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/7113)
